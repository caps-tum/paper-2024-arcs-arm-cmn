This folder contains the software developed for the paper.

The `launcher` folder contains a simple wrapper script for launching OpenMP applications.

The  `cmn_topology_tool` contains the tool used for gathering all data surrounding the CMN topology.
Note: This folder is added as a git submodule. 
You might have to run `git submodule update --recursive --remote` if you don't see it.
You can also find the sources here, should this fail: https://gitlab.lrz.de/friese-arm-cmn/topology-tool
